 
 This is a Quiz software I was required to develop
 for 1 of my customer.
 But later the order was cancelled as I could not
 complete the project in time.
  Any way I have completed the project almost 80%
  You can add your own questions and prize amount
 for the quiz game.

  The quiz screen is made as much attractive as
 possible, if viewed in high resolution.

  Also, the questions are asked randomly based on
 it's difficulty level.

  The player can take help for answering the question 
by using the three life lines.
  
  Also I have made a windows like help file which
you can use by pressing F1. Here I am also given the
Ms Word version of the help file through which I have compiled
and made .rtf file.

  All the database connectivity is done through one single
module named connection.bas

  Over and all it is a good program to learn many things
like database connections, using random function, graphics
effect, File Input/Output functions, Playing background music
in applications etc.

  So please check the program and give your
 opinions.
  Your advice may help me in my future projects...


1 thing to be noted is that whenever required to quit
the game you will have to exit only from the main screen,
clicking on the exit button.

Then other screen showing author's detail will be
displayed, but it will end automatically.

In between if u try to quit the game any other way,
then sorry but your desktop will also get hidden.

So Remember you need to quit the game only from the 
exit button and wait for the game to end in its own.

Anyone interested can add more features like text-to-Speech...


So if anyone can do this please let me know and if possible
send me the modified files...

Thanks
Vikrant....
